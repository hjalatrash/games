Working graphics project in C using SDL2...

This uses Code::Blocks, used SDL2 project template when creating the project.

Had to download SDL2 from here: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.5

- Libraries and headers from here: SDL2-devel-2.28.5-mingw.zip
- DLL to be placed in running path from: SDL2-2.28.5-win32-x64.zip

To compile properly:

- In project build options -> search directories -> compiler: add "..\SDL2-2.28.5\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include"
- In project build options -> search directories -> linker: add "..\SDL2-2.28.5\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib"
- Make sure main gets argc & argv: int main( int argc, char * argv[] )


ChatGPT is a great resource to suggest code.. that's where most of that came from.
