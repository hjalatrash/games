Working graphics project in C using SDL2...

This uses Code::Blocks, used SDL2 project template when creating the project.

Had to download SDL2 from here: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.5

- Libraries and headers from here: SDL2-devel-2.28.5-mingw.zip
- DLL to be placed in running path from: SDL2-2.28.5-win32-x64.zip

To compile properly:

- In project build options -> search directories -> compiler: add "..\SDL2-2.28.5\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include"
- In project build options -> search directories -> linker: add "..\SDL2-2.28.5\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib"
- Make sure main gets argc & argv: int main( int argc, char * argv[] )


ChatGPT is a great resource to suggest code.. that's where most of that came from.


Adding support for text:
------------------------

Downloaded from here: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases
SDL2_ttf-devel-2.20.2-mingw.zip

To compile properly:
- In project build options -> Linker settings and add the following link libraries:
	* ..\SDL2_ttf-2.20.2\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib\libSDL2_ttf.dll.a
	* ..\SDL2_ttf-2.20.2\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib\libSDL2_ttf.a
	** the order mattered for some reason.  When libSDL2_ttf.a was first, i got a million errors.
- In project build options -> search libraries -> compiler: add "..\SDL2_ttf-2.20.2\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2"
- In project build options -> search libraries -> compiler: add "..\SDL2-2.28.5\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2"
- In project build options -> search libraries -> Liner: add "..\SDL2_ttf-2.20.2\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib"

Downloaded generic TTF font files from the internet.
